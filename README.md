# Bookish_Flexdashboard
An easy way to visualise trends in reading patterns. Ideally, you shouldn't need to actually know anything about coding to run this. The markdown file pulls the data to populate your flexdashboard from a google sheet.


# Why use this dashboard?
I love reading and like to keep a record of the things I read, details about the book, and how I felt about it. I also really like data science and creating products that prioritise the user benefitting from engagement. The trouble with this, though, is that it can be tricky to find data products that don't require the user to have their own substantial data science skillsets. 

To this end, I created this flexdashboard. There are a couple of small changes that you'll need to make to run it, but those are detailed in the instructions at the top of the markdown (RMD) file. There is also a CSV file which tells you what the column names should be in your google sheet and how to structure the data in it so your flexdashboard will run without errors. 

I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!
