Column Header,Data Format,Explanation,,
Year,Factor,The year when I read the book.,,

Start_Finish,0/1,Indicates whether or not I started and then finished the book.,,
Start_DNF,0/1,"Indicates whether I started but did not finish the book. I generally include in the Notes field what percentage of the book I wrote when I leave an explanation. I do sometimes attempt again to read a book, so some are double listed (I liberally apply the filter command to account for this).",,

Library_Hold,0/1,Indicates whether I have the book on hold at the library,,
Fiction,Character,"Recorded as either Fiction or Non-Fiction. This could have been stored as a binary variable, but recording it directly saves me the effort of mutating the data later. ",,
Genre,Character,"The book’s genre. I usually keep this quite broad (e.g., history, romance, young adult, poetry). There are many ways to use this field and subgenre, but I tend to use major groupings in here and then more specific ones in the subgenre field. For example, I tend to use something like Poetry as genre and something more specific like Roman Epic, Contemporary, or Greek Lyrical as my subgenre. As long as you’re consistent, R will do the work for you here. Note that you will need to make modifications to your Genre Tabs to make use of these categories. ",,
Subgenre,Character,The book's subgenre.,,
Pages,Numeric,Number of pages in the book. I use the number in Apple Books to account for differences in typeface and book height/width,,

Rating,Numeric,Graded on a 5-point Likert scale,,
